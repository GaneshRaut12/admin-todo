# MyApp README.md

## Description

MyApp is a web application that allows users to manage their to-do lists. It provides two main modules: UserModule and TodoModule. The UserModule handles user-related functionalities such as user creation, retrieval, and deletion. On the other hand, the TodoModule is responsible for managing tasks or to-do items associated with each user.

## Features

1. **UserModule**
   - Create User: Users can be created using this functionality.
   - Get All Users: Retrieve a list of all users that have been created.
   - Delete User: Remove a user from the system.

2. **TodoModule**
   - Add Todo: Users can add tasks to their to-do lists.
   - Delete Todo: Remove a specific task from a user's to-do list.
   - Get Completed Todos: Retrieve a list of to-do items that have been marked as completed for a specific user.
   - Get Pending Todos: Retrieve a list of to-do items that are yet to be completed for a specific user.
   - Update Todo Status: Users can update the status of a task from "not complete" to "complete."

## AppModule - Main Module

The AppModule serves as the main entry point of the application and handles the following tasks:

1. **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the application's database to store user information and to-do items.

2. **Module Imports:** Imports and integrates the UserModule and TodoModule functionalities into the main application.
